Anyone could suggest and vote on the theme. Once a theme was selected, everyone would have ten days to submit <em>something</em> based around it.</p>

<p>The Jam’s theme was “<strong>Sun and Moon</strong>”</p>

<p>The entries are in order of submission. Those who submitted earlier appear close to the top.</p>

<h2 id="sightless-stars">“Sightless Stars”</h2>

<p>What of the tale of twin lovers,<br />
Who dance through the ages unknown?<br />
Their celestial dance uncovers<br />
The world we call our own.<br />
He, the impossible ball of cosmic fire,<br />
King who incinerates evil with ease.<br />
She, the globe that reflects a forgotten desire,<br />
Amnesiac queen who governs the seas.<br />
Together, they are on a mission.<br />
To create something greater than they<br />
Is the noblest ambition,<br />
Despite what sightless stars may say.</p>

<p>- The Altruist</p>

<h2 id="cyber-city">“Cyber City”</h2>

<p>A futuristic city that is controlled by day and chaotic by night.</p>

<h2 id="aperture">“Aperture”</h2>

<p>A simple drawing I made based on the relevant prompt that was given to me, and as you’d be able to fairly easily tell from the drawing, I was quite literal with my approach.</p>
